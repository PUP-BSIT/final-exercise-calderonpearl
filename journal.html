                If there’s one question that I would ask myself 5 years from
                now, it would be “Are you still lost?”.  </p>
            <p>
                As a person whose life revolved around academics, I had no 
                chance of knowing who truly was or what I wanted. Sure I did 
                try lots of things outside of the four corners of our 
                classroom, yet I didn’t get a chance to focus on one because 
                I just simply don’t know what to do and desire. Growing up 
                feels like I am just trying lots of stuff to waltz my way out 
                of every situation I am in and cope with the chaos I experience 
                personally. Being an achiever made me believe that soon enough, 
                it will pave my way to a bright future. My academic 
                achievements will be a reflection of me. </p>
            <p> Unfortunately, I’ve been facing its repercussions. </p>
            <p> When I entered college, choosing BSIT as my course (not
                because it was my personal choice, it was my mom’s because I 
                didn’t know what I would pursue at that moment when I needed 
                to choose already), I believed that this was just another era 
                of studying. I am going to be fine like what I’ve been before. 
                I’m just going to continue what I’ve been doing for almost 13 
                years already. </p>
            <p> Along the way, I realized how shallow my perspective was. 
                Indeed, one can learn from exerting lots of effort in studying 
                to become a professional, yet it is a tough one especially if
                you did not envision yourself being in this industry in the 
                first place. Then one night, I hoped that I was excellent like
                some of my classmates who were passionate about this course
                so that I wouldn’t worry about studying so much stuff while
                placing my happiness in doubt. </p>
            <p> This is a part of my journey where I feel like I balk 
                uncontrollably. I know for sure that I am doing what I can to
                love the things that spiral into this course, and to enhance
                myself, especially with the way I think because I am very 
                willing to give this career a chance, yet there are tons of 
                times that I cry myself out because reality just slapped me and 
                telling me that just because I’m giving it a chance, surely I 
                am going to hit the spot of being qualified. Sometimes, I need 
                to accept that I cannot force something that isn’t what reality 
                favors me. </p>
            <p> It still kind of aches whenever I remember myself sitting in 
                front of my laptop with such blurry eyes because of tears while 
                I was trying to understand a topic, literally reading 
                everything from word to word, trying to understand it on my own
                because I just don’t want to put it in my code without having 
                an in-depth understanding about it. While also continuously 
                asked myself that if I will not be excellent with this career, 
                where would I be in the future? </p>
            <p> Now that I’ve been feeling like I’m doing such an average 
                performance in academics, literally affecting some of my 
                subjects because of the weight of my programming subject, I am 
                losing my ground, freefalling with no particular destination. 
                This narrows down my vision to a bright future. </p>
            <p> Nonetheless, I still learned other stuff in my college journey 
                so far that isn’t academic related. One thing is that I became 
                more human. I learned how to truly acknowledge myself, also 
                always prioritizing figuring out my preferences and what I want
                to be, a person that my younger self would admire. As a bit of 
                a nonchalant student before, I always cared about my school 
                performance instead of giving some attention to the real world. 
                But now, I have begun to appreciate the value of listening and 
                considering different viewpoints, which exposed me to a 
                diverse range of perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences, 
                fostering a deeper sense of empathy within me. I realized that 
                I shouldn’t feel so doomed just because I still haven’t found 
                my niche. I should still be proud of myself because of some 
                tiny bits of progress that I gained along my college journey 
                because learning encompasses personal growth, interpersonal
                skills, and a broader understanding of the world. </p>
            <p> In 5 years, I still don’t want to pressure myself, yet I hope 
                to find myself found in a career that I can be proud of, 
                because of my skills. Certainly, the IT industry is impressive, 
                yet I don’t want to be defined by the industry, I still want to 
                be defined by how my expertise and competence contribute to the 
                industry itself. Even so, it’s too early to say that this may 
                not be for me, I’m still not going to give up, yet. I’m still 
                eager to find my niche with the vast opportunities that the IT 
                industry offers. For now, I envision myself taking challenges 
                that push me to the boundaries of my knowledge and allow me to 
                make a meaningful impact. I understand that my aspirations may 
                evolve, and that's perfectly okay. What matters most is my 
                commitment to my personal and professional growth and staying 
                true to my values because I don’t want to be an inhumane 
                professional. </p>
            <p> I am sculpting a narrative that reflects not only my 
                professional achievements but the authentic essence of 
                who I am becoming. </p>
